# Tripadvisor Homepage Clone 

This is a **frontend-only clone** of the Tripadvisor homepage hero section.  
I built this project to practice **HTML, CSS and responsive design**.

# Project Overview

- Replica of the top part of Tripadvisor:
  - Logo + top navigation bar
  - Tabs (`Search All`, `Hotels`, `Things to Do`, `Restaurants`)
  - Search card with input + green CTA button
  - Experience / booking card (image + text)
- Fully responsive:
  - Desktop layout similar to original site
  - Mobile layout with:
    - Compact top bar
    - Hamburger menu icon
    - Full-width search card and button

This project is only for **learning and practice**.  
All design inspiration is from [tripadvisor.com](https://www.tripadvisor.com) – I do **not** own any of their brand, logo or assets.
